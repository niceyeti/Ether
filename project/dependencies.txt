To run all this, you'll need:
pyethereum
serpent
hashlib
rsa

to install these, use:
sudo pip install pyethereum
sudo pip install hashlib
sudo pip install serpent


If any installs fail, try just re-running the above commands. This often works because pip screws up the install
order of dependencies, and has them by the second attempt to install.
